# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, please report it privately rather than opening a public issue.

**Email:** [your-email@example.com]

I'll respond as quickly as possible and work with you to understand and address the issue.

## Scope

This is a client-side React application. The main security considerations are:

- **API keys** — User-provided keys are stored in browser localStorage and never transmitted to any server
- **Dependencies** — I try to keep dependencies updated, but PRs for security patches are welcome

## What to Expect

- Acknowledgment within 72 hours (usually faster)
- An honest assessment of the issue
- Credit in the fix if you want it
