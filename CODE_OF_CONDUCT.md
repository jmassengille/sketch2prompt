# Code of Conduct

## The Short Version

Be respectful. This is a solo-maintained project, so patience is appreciated.

## Guidelines

- **Be constructive** — Bug reports, feature requests, and critiques are welcome when they're actionable
- **Be patient** — Response times vary; this isn't my full-time job
- **Be kind** — Assume good intent from others

## Scope

This applies to all project spaces: issues, pull requests, and discussions.

## Enforcement

Unacceptable behavior may result in removal from project spaces. Use your judgment — if you wouldn't say it to a colleague, don't say it here.

## Contact

Open an issue or reach out directly if there's a problem.
